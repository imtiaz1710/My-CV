Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in a Software Engineer position. With approximately 4 years of professional experience, I specialize in building scalable, efficient, and modern software systems using C#, .NET 8, Angular, and Azure.

My core competencies include database systems (SQL, MongoDB, Entity Framework Core, Dapper), architectural patterns (Clean, n-tier, Microservices, SOLID principles), cloud technologies (Azure Service Bus), authentication (JWT, Role-based Access Control), deployment (Docker), and project management (Jira, Trello). I also possess expertise in advanced C# concepts, the .NET ecosystem (Dependency Injection, Fluent Validation), and real-time communication with SignalR.

I am confident my comprehensive skill set aligns well with your requirements and am eager to contribute. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Thank you and best regards,
Imtiaz Zaman Mehedi
